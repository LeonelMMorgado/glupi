# glupi
glupi (GL Unified Programming Interface) is an interface for easier use of OpenGL, allowing creation of windows, entities, cameras and other basic necessities.

# Requisites
For this project to work on your machine, you will need glfw built as a library on your compiler folder and glad on there as well, not to mention OpenGL itself and a C compiler.

# Usage
Download the project and check the source code, there is examples of how it should be used:

Define functions to run on initialize, update, draw and on exit. The program expects many things such as shaders from you, but will provide others, like camera and Vectors, for easier implementation.
